Here using the first 4 Chapters of Moby-Dick we train are ANN to generate the next probable word
If we contive this process- generate next probable word - for n number of ittiration we are able to generate entire sentences
After n number of ittration we can cross the seed input and pridict on our own pridicted words leading to seedless pridictions



Since traning an ANN requred more time resources if you want to try out the model that I have created 
you can just load the model and work with it


NOTE# All the data used to train the model is included
